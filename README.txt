Running

The easiest way I find to run this chat bot is running it in command line/terminal.
In command line, go to the directory you have the files located in and run the command "python bot.py".

The bot may also be started by double clicking bot.py. But if it doesn't work, start it in command line.
A batch script could also be made to run the bot if you are on windows. Just cd to the directory and then run the "python bot.py" command.
